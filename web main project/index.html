							How Social Media Effects Body Image
						</div>
						<div class="para">
							Social media sites like Facebook,Twitter, and Instagram have become a huge part of most teens’ lives. But do they help or hurt our self-esteem and body image? <br><br>
							A recent CNN article explored how we are now exposed to more and more images of unattainable beauty, thanks to social networking: “Before social networks, we mostly had images of impossibly perfect celebrities. We would pass these images on billboards, watch them on TV, flip through them in magazines, but we weren't sitting around staring at them for hours every day.” <br><br>
							And it’s not just the exposure to these images that is damaging. It’s our interaction with them—the pressure to have the perfect profile pics, the comparisons we make, and the dangers of the constant scrutiny of our own and others’ bodies.

							Here’s what teens had to say about how social networking sites impact the way they feel about themselves
						</div>
						<div class="para2">
							“It's only the 'standard beauty' who gets the 'likes.' I feel like to be the hot girl, you have to be like that, or wear your shirt too low and your skirt too high.”<br>-Kirby, 18
							<br><br><br><br>
							“People get positive attention in the world by losing weight. And you can do it to an even greater extent on Facebook.”<br>-Anika, 18

						<div class="para3">
							“I know a ten year old girl who stopped eating after reading comments online that people had made about a picture of teen star Demi Lovato. Things like comments or tweets may seem simple, but they can really impact girls in a negative way by causing them to have unrealistic expectations about what thin is. I've seen that and experienced that.”<br>-Jen, 17
							<br><br><br><br>
							“I think that social media platforms hurt because young people are now having their bodies judged online in addition to being judged in person, which causes them to feel trapped.”<br>-Jen, 17
