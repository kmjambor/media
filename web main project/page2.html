							Improving Body Image And Self Love
						</div>
						<div class="para4">
							<p class="number">1.</p> Stop comparing yourself to others.
								Everyone has something they wish they could change about their body. Wishing you had someone else's thighs or curly hair or smile takes away from what is uniquely you. Accentuating the qualities you like will boost your spirits and minimize the things you don't like.
								<br><br>
							<p class="number">2.</p> Focus on what you have the power to change.
								Rather than spending your energy on wishing you were taller, redirect your focus on something you can change, like toning up with a yoga or pilates class or honing one of your talents. Then celebrate with a nice pair of heels.
								<br><br>
							<p class="number">3.</p> Dress as if you're where you want to 	be.
								If you're wearing the same uninspiring clothes that make you feel drab, pick up a few smart wardrobe pieces. The better you feel, the more likely you'll be motivated to keep making positive changes.
								<br><br>
							<p class="number">4.</p> Practice self-care.
								The more you love and take care of what you have now, the more likely you'll move in the direction of self-improvement. Schedule "me time" to take a warm, soothing bath, massage your skin with olive oil, read an inspiring book, or write in your journal.

							Improving Body Image And Self Love Continued
						</div>

						<div class="para5">
							<p class="number">5.</p>Build a support System.
							Spend time with people who have a positive influence on you and that energize you rather than reinforce bad habits. Exercise together, swap healthy recipes, and champion one another when you're making progress.
								<br><br>
							<p class="number">6.</p>Treat yourself as you do others.
							Would you ever dream of talking to someone that way you talk to yourself? Change takes time and the more compassion and self-acceptance you practice, the better you'll take care of yourself.
								<br><br>
							<p class="number">7.</p>Practice gratitiude.
							The more you appreciate what you have, the more you will have to be thankful for, and this includes good health. Keep a gratitude list and add to it when you wake up in the morning and before you go to bed at night.
								<br><br>
							<p class="number">8.</p>Work on your inner-self.
							We are spiritual beings living a human experience and we are here to learn and grow. When you listen to your inner guidance and live your life based on its wisdom, people will see the beauty and creativity of the real you that's inside the flesh and bones.
